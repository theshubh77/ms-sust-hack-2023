ShareEat is a mobile app that aims to connect local food businesses with community members who are interested in reducing food waste and saving money on meals. The app allows businesses to post their surplus food inventory, as well as deals such as buy 1 get 1 free or stock clearance sales. Users can then browse and purchase these items at a discounted price, while also contributing to reducing food waste.

The app will utilize several AI features, such as machine learning algorithms to suggest personalized deals for users, and image recognition technology to ensure accurate inventory management. Additionally, the app will feature map-based searching and real-time notifications to enhance the user experience.

ShareEat's target customers are both local food businesses and community members looking to save money on meals and reduce food waste. The app has the potential to generate revenue through a commission-based model for businesses, as well as advertising and premium features for users.

In terms of social impact, ShareEat aims to contribute to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) such as reducing food waste, promoting sustainable consumption and production, and eradicating poverty. As a prototype, the app is still in its early stages, but has the potential to make a significant impact on the food industry and contribute to a more sustainable future.
